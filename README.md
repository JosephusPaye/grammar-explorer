# Grammar Explorer

Analyse, search, and interactively explore context free grammars. <https://peaceful-bhabha-5a131e.netlify.com/>

This project is released as a part of [#CreateWeekly](https://dev.to/josephuspaye/createweekly-create-something-new-publicly-every-week-in-2020-1nh9), my attempt to create something new publicly every week in 2020.

Was originally written in 2019 when I did [COMP3290: Compiler Design](https://www.newcastle.edu.au/course/COMP3290).

## Features

### Analyse

You can analyse non-terminals in the grammar, to:

- find left and right recursion
- compute common prefixes
- compute FIRST and FOLLOW sets
- find nullable non-terminals

### Search

You can filter the list of non terminals by one or more terms concurrently. This feature handily beats <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> in a PDF file!

### Explore

You can interactively expand non-terminals (recursively even!) and see possible derivations.
